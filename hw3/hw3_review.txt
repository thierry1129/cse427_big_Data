This homework Is reasonably long, it is really straightfowad, most of the problems could be figured out using the lab as an example. However, we did run into some trouble executing average wordlength jobs locally, it turned out the syntax we use to prompt the job in command line is wrong. We hope that the professor could provide a list of useful command line prompts for us to reference it quickly.
